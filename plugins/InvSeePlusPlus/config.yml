#   inventory:
#     - i_xx is a regular inventory 'container' slot (xx being the slot number)
#     - a_x is an armour slot: b for boots, l for leggings, c for chest and h for helmet
#     - oh is the offhand slot
#     - c is the cursor slot
#     - p_xx is a 'personal' slot, where the contents of the player's crafting items / anvil items / enchanting table items / etc. live
#     - _ is an unused slot
#   enderchest:
#     - e_xx is a regular enderchest 'container' slot (xx being the slot number)
